prepromali : preprocess multiple alignment (for PSICOV)
-------------------------------------------------------
The program reads in FASTA multiple alignment (--maliIn)
and query sequence header (--query_i),
removes the alignment columns corresponding to gapped positions 
in the query sequence and prints out the ungapped (referring to
the query sequence) multiple alignment with the query sequence
at the top. The resulting multiple alignment is printed in two formats,
FASTA and headless (sequence headers removed), the latter as input
for PSICOV.

The '--maliJoin <alignment input>' option is intended to append a
second multiple alignment, where the sequences are automatically
paired with those of the '--maliIn  <alignment input>' alignment.
A separate query '--query_j' should be provided for this alignment.
Both query sequences will be be joined at the top of the alignment.
Pairing of the remaining sequences requires their headers to have 
the same sequence name excluding the residue numbering, for example
'>D5H7Z3_SALRM/2-344' would be paired with 
'>D5H7Z3_SALRM/359-474'.
It is assumed that the separator character to the residue numbering is '/'.
Although technically not required for this program, it makes sense 
to join the C-terminal mali (--maliJoin) to the N-terminal mali (--maliIn)
to avoid complications when mapping the correlations onto a structure. 

If you provide the 'firstSeqResidue' and 'firstStrResidue' numbers,
an additional file will be created for each alignment that lists
the sequence and its various numberings.


Install / Uninstall
-------------------
Please read the general 'INSTALL' instructions.

The configuration option '--enable-debug' creates a debuggable binary,
the option '--enable-profiling' enables profiling with 'gprof'.
